# TOGAR: Installation Guide  
TOGAR is a gated diffusion framework for spatial transcriptomics analysis, which adopts a two-stage architecture: first, it denoises gene expression profiles through GCN combined with ZINB loss, then uses a diffusion model incorporating gated linear attention and rotary positional encoding to refine the data, and finally averages the refined data with the denoised data to form the final gene expression profile data.
It mainly addresses issues such as sparsity and inaccurate spatial domain identification in spatial transcriptomics data, improves the accuracy of cell clustering, can better capture long-range spatial dependencies and spatial expression patterns of genes, and provides support for the analysis of tissue microenvironments and other related fields.
This document provides the environment setup and installation steps for TOGAR.  


## 1. Environment Preparation  
Create a dedicated Conda environment for TOGAR:  
```bash
# Create and activate the environment
conda create -n TOGAR
source activate TOGAR  # For Linux/macOS; use "conda activate TOGAR" for Windows

# Install Python
conda install python=3.8
```


## 2. Dependencies Installation  
Install required packages via Conda and pip:  

### Conda Packages  
```bash
# Install system-level dependencies
conda install conda-forge::gmp
conda install conda-forge::pot

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support (CUDA 11.8)
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

### Pip Packages  
```bash
pip install scanpy
pip install anndata==0.8.0
pip install pandas==1.4.2
pip install rpy2==3.5.1  # For R package integration
pip install scikit-learn==1.1.1
pip install scipy==1.8.1
pip install tqdm==4.64.0
pip install einops
```


## 3. R Package Installation  
Install the required R package `mclust` via `rpy2`:  
```python
import rpy2.robjects as robjects

robjects.r('''
    install.packages('mclust')
''')
```
